# Sadegh's Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). The site showcases my professional background, projects, and technical skills.

## About This Project

This website serves as a digital representation of my work and expertise. It's designed to be simple, fast, and responsive, leveraging the power of Next.js for optimal performance.

## Demo
The demo is available on [sadegh.id.ir](https://sadegh.id.ir)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
